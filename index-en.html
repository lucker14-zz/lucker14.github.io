                    <p>We provide the company's management with a detailed and comprehensible analysis of the current state of the organization or selected divisions based on structured interviews with employees across the entire organizational structure. These projects provided us with the opportunity to get to know in detail the functioning of large corporations and small family businesses and to gain a unique overview of both the pitfalls and best practices in management and employee motivation. We can thus deliver not only an analysis of the situation, but also provide specific solutions for your company.</p>

This cooperation has provided us with a completely new insight into the soul of our company. It has helped us better understand our colleagues and their view on Buřinka as an employer, and identify what our employees value and what should be changed.  Jan and Jiří even helped us define basic principles of a new corporate culture and its implementation in the company. What do I especially appreciate in this cooperation? Honest and practical approach, open, constructive and inspiring discussion and sharing of experiences on similar projects in other companies.”</p>

The in-depth survey carried out across the entire branch network helped all of us better understand the current state of affairs, problems, and everyday concerns that our employees on the front line are faced with. We were impressed not only by the complexity and depth of the identified topics, but also the particularly accurate and comprehensible analysis of problems outlined in the fields of processing, motivation, and the cooperation of bank divisions, as well as the view of our employees and the brand image of the company they work for. For me, this view was particularly valuable at a time when I held the position of newly appointed Director of the Retail Division and had to quickly and accurately navigate the current situation while making quick and correct decisions.”</p>

I enjoyed working with Jiri for reason that we did not only reach a great results which really fitted the organization and what we stand for, but as well for the ownership he showed in pulling this off together. Jiri was not afraid to challenge our assumptions based on his own insights and insights gained from our employees during the interviews and observations.”</p>

Though, only questioning cannot always provide an accurate picture of all issues concerning your employees and we are often unable to identify potential discontent due to our professional blindness. Through in-depth interviews with our employees, Motivate has helped us set the mirror properly. Outputs from the survey have contributed to the decision where to focus our energy and attention. We believe that the more enthusiastic and committed employees we have, the better the Česká spořitelna will do. The collaboration with the tandem of Jiří Žižka and Jan Šmída was excellent and professional. The quality outputs showed clearly their extensive knowledge and experience in the field of in-depth surveys. Great job, guys!”</p>

                    <p>Have you just taken over the management of a company or division? Is your company undergoing transformation? Have you recently merged two companies or brands? Company assessment is the right tool to know what is really happening at your company and what the real motivators and opinions of your employees are. Through structured, in-depth interviews with selected employees in your organization we can uncover hidden or unresolved problems at all levels of management and correctly assess the situation in the company before you take strategic decisions.</p>

                    <p>Do you want to have a regular overview of how the satisfaction and motivation of your employees is developing? Or you just need to quickly determine the attitude to change or to a specific topic across the entire company or only selected division? In that case, a quantitative survey in the form of online polling is appropriate. You will receive quick and accurate answers to the questions that interest you and get a comparison with the attitude of your employees not only over time, but also in comparison with the overall market. Unlike other research firms, drawing on similar benchmarks from European or even non-European markets, we always have up to date benchmarks exclusively from employees of companies operating in the Czech Republic.</p>

I have always liked to look for common denominators and analyze the motivators and motivations governing people when they are deciding whether buy selected product or in their work and personal life. That is something I decided to dedicate fulltime in our own company Motivate. Even after hundreds of in-depth interviews with employees of large corporations and small companies on the subject of their motivation it still fascinates me how simple motives can often be a source of great motivation or demotivation contrary, in work life. In my work, I not only try to find these sources, but also to use them to increase employee motivation and satisfaction.

In 2003, when I took over the management of the, at the time, rather small Alfa Bank in Moscow, even I had no idea that it would grow 10 times in five years and become the largest privately owned bank in Russia, which will be evaluated by international media as the best bank in Russia for three consecutive years.

In the beginning there was one belief, accompanied by positive energy, diligence of the entire implementation team, but mainly a shared clear vision of where to go and how to achieve it.
