<p>NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW IN YOUR USUAL PLACE OF RESIDENCE. IF THERE IS A CONFLICT BETWEEN THOSE RIGHTS AND THESE TERMS, YOUR RIGHTS UNDER APPLICABLE LOCAL LAW WILL PREVAIL.</p>

<p> 1. Contract between You and Us</p>

<p>This is a contract between you and Disney Interactive, a California corporation located at 500 South Buena Vista Street, Burbank, California 91521, USA, or between you and any different service provider identified for a particular Disney Service. You must read and agree to these terms before using the Disney Services. If you do not agree, you may not use the Disney Services. These terms describe the limited basis on which the Disney Services are available and supersede prior agreements or arrangements.</p>

<p>Supplemental terms and conditions may apply to some Disney Services, such as rules for a particular competition, service or other activity, or terms that may accompany certain content or software accessible through the Disney Services. Supplemental terms and conditions will be disclosed to you in connection with such competition, service or activity. Any supplemental terms and conditions are in addition to these terms and, in the event of a conflict, prevail over these terms.</p>

<p>We may amend these terms. Any such amendment will be effective thirty (30) days following either our dispatch of a notice to you or our posting of the amendment on the Disney Services. If you do not agree to any change to these terms, you must discontinue using the Disney Services. Our customer service representatives are not authorized to modify any provision of these terms, either verbally or in writing.</p>

We are not responsible for, and do not endorse or guarantee, the opinions, views, advice or recommendations posted or sent by users.</p>

<p>Accounts</p>

<p>Some Disney Services permit or require you to create an account to participate or to secure additional benefits. You agree to provide and maintain accurate, current and complete information, including your contact information for notices and other communications from us and your payment information. You agree not to impersonate or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity, including using another person&rsquo;s username, password or other account information, or another person&rsquo;s name or likeness, or provide false details for a parent or guardian. You agree that we may take steps to verify the accuracy of information you provide, including contact information for a parent or guardian.</p>

<p>We have adopted and implemented a policy that provides for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of the accounts of users who are repeat infringers of copyright. In addition, we may suspend or terminate your account and your ability to use the Disney Services if you engage in, encourage or advocate for illegal conduct, or if you fail to comply with these terms or any supplemental terms.</p>

<p>You are responsible for taking reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of your username and password, and you are responsible for all activities under your account that you can reasonably control.

<p>The security, integrity and confidentiality of your information are extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures that are designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use and modification.</p>

<p>4. Paid Transactions</p>

<p>Identity of Seller</p>

<p>Sales are made by Disney Interactive or the seller identified at the time of sale, if different. If you have questions about your order, please contact the seller at the address provided and they will assist you. Some storefronts on the Disney Services are operated by third parties and, in that case, different or additional sale terms may apply, which you should read when they are presented to you.</p>

<p>Digital Content and Virtual Items</p>

<p>We may make applications, games, software or other digital content available on the Disney Services for you to license for a one-time fee. When purchasing a license to access such material from a Disney Service, charges will be disclosed to you on the Disney Service before you complete the license purchase.</p>

<p>Your purchase of a virtual item or in-game currency is a payment for a limited, non-assignable license to access and use such content or functionality in the Disney Services. Virtual items (including characters and character names) or in-game currency purchased or available to you in the Disney Services can only be used in connection with the Disney Services where you obtained them or where they were developed by you as a result of game play. These items are not redeemable or subject to refund and cannot be traded outside of the Disney Services for money or other items for value. We may modify or discontinue virtual items or in-game currency at any time.</p>

<p>Subscriptions</p>

<p>Some Disney Services require paid subscriptions to access. By signing up for a subscription, you agree that your subscription will be automatically renewed and, unless you cancel your subscription, you authorize us to charge your payment method for the renewal term. The period of auto-renewal will be the same as your initial subscription period unless otherwise disclosed to you at the time of sale. The renewal rate will be no more than the rate for the immediately prior subscription period, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless we notify you of a rate change prior to your auto-renewal. From time to time, we may offer a free trial subscription for a Disney Service. If you register for a free trial subscription, we will begin to bill your account when the free trial subscription expires, unless you cancel your subscription before that time.</p>

<p>The Order Process</p>

<p>You will have the opportunity to review and confirm your order, including delivery address (if applicable), payment method and product details. We will send to you a notice when we accept your order and our acceptance will be deemed complete and for all purposes to have been effectively communicated to you at the time we send the notice. At such time, the contract for sale will be made and become binding on both you and us. The risk of loss in any goods you purchase and the responsibility to insure them passes to you when the relevant goods are delivered.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order prior to delivery. Some situations that may result in your order being cancelled include system or typographical errors, inaccuracies in product or pricing information or product availability, fairness among customers where supplies are limited, or problems identified by our credit or fraud departments. We also may require additional verification or information before accepting an order. We will contact you if any portion of your order is cancelled or if additional information is required to accept your order. If your order is cancelled after we have processed your payment but prior to delivery, we will refund your payment.</p>

<p>Payments and Billing</p>

<p>When you provide payment information, you represent and warrant that the information is accurate, that you are authorized to use the payment method provided, and that you will notify us of changes to the payment information. We reserve the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to obtain current expiration dates on credit cards.</p>

<p>Right of Cancellation; Return of Goods</p>

<p>When you subscribe to a Disney Service, you have the right to cancel your contract within fourteen (14) days after your receipt and acceptance of these terms and you will receive a full refund of the subscription fee paid. For semi-annual and annual subscriptions, if notice of cancellation is received within the first thirty (30) days following the first day of initial billing, you will receive a refund of the subscription fee paid. If we refund your subscription fee, you will still be obligated to pay other charges incurred.</p>

<p>When you purchase a license to access digital content or virtual items, you will be given an opportunity to consent to delivery at the time of purchase. By consenting to delivery, you acknowledge that you have lost the right to cancel and the license purchase fee is non-refundable.</p>

<p>You have the right, within thirty (30) days from the date of your receipt of physical goods, to cancel our contract with you and return the goods. This right does not apply to goods stated by us on the Disney Services to be non-returnable, including audio and video recordings, computer software, and CD&rsquo;s, DVD&rsquo;s or other physical media that have been unsealed. If you are returning goods that are not faulty, you may be required to pay for the cost of returning the goods to us and we may deduct a reasonable amount if you use the goods.</p>

<p>If you wish to cancel, you must do so by following the cancellation instructions for the particular Disney Service. A sample cancellation form is available here.</p>

<p>Personalized Goods</p>

<p>Please note that the rights of cancellation and return do not apply for personalized goods. Cancellations and changes to personalized goods cannot be made once you have submitted your order and personalized items cannot be returned unless there is a manufacturing error or product defect. We reserve the right to refuse personalized orders at our discretion. Inappropriate use of our personalization service will cause your order to be cancelled and any payment refunded.</p>

<p>Pricing; Taxes</p>

<p>We may revise the pricing for products and services we offer. If you pay a periodic subscription fee for a Disney Service, we will provide you with reasonable notice of changes to the fees or billing methods in advance of their effective date and you will be able to cancel your subscription prior to such change. When you place your order, we estimate the tax and include that estimate in the total for your convenience. The actual tax amount that will be applied to your order and charged to your payment method is based on calculations on the date of shipment, regardless of when the order was placed.</p>

<p>International Shipping; Customs</p>

<p>When ordering goods for delivery to countries other than the country where the seller is located, you may have to pay import duties and taxes levied. These and any additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by you. For goods shipped internationally, please note that any manufacturer warranty may not be valid; manufacturer service options may not be available; manuals, instructions and safety warnings may not be in destination country languages; the goods and accompanying materials may not be designed in accordance with destination country standards, specifications, and labeling requirements; and the goods may not conform to destination country voltage (requiring use of an adapter or converter). You are responsible for assuring the goods can be lawfully imported to the destination country. When ordering from us, the recipient is the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the destination country.</p>

<p>5. Competitions</p>

<p>Competitions that you enter on a Disney Service may have supplemental rules and conditions, but the following general rules apply absent contrary terms in any supplemental rules or conditions for the competition.</p>

<p>Entries</p>

<p>Your competition entry is User Generated Content and subject to all provisions of these terms that govern your submission and our use of your User Generated Content. We may disqualify entries that are late, misdirected, incomplete, corrupted, lost, illegible or invalid or where appropriate parental consent was not provided. Competition entries are limited to one per person and entries via agents or third parties or the use of multiple identities are not permitted. Use of automated entries, votes or other programs is prohibited and all such entries (or votes) will be disqualified.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, cancel or terminate a competition or extend or resume the entry period or disqualify any participant or entry at any time without giving advance notice. We will do so if it cannot be guaranteed the competition can be carried out fairly or correctly for technical, legal or other reasons, or if we suspect that any person has manipulated entries or results, provided false information or acted unethically. If we cancel or terminate a competition, prizes may be awarded in any manner we deem fair and appropriate consistent with local laws governing the competition.</p>

<p>Eligibility</p>

<p>To enter a competition, you must be a registered user of the Disney Services and have an active account with current contact information. No purchase is necessary to enter a competition and a purchase will not improve your chances of winning. Competitions are not open to our employees (or their immediate families) or anyone else professionally associated with the competition. If you are under age 18 (or the age of majority under applicable law) and the competition is open to you, we may need your parent or guardian&rsquo;s consent before we can accept your entry. We reserve the right to request proof of identity or to verify eligibility conditions and potential winning entries, and to award any prize to a winner in person. Competitions are void where prohibited or restricted by law. Potential winners who are residents in jurisdictions where competitions require an element of skill may be required to answer a mathematical test in order to be eligible to win a prize.</p>

<p>Prizes</p>

<p>No cash or alternative prizes are available, except that we (or the party providing a prize) reserve the right to substitute a similar prize of equal or greater value. Prizes cannot be transferred (except to a child or other family member) or sold by winners. Only the number of prizes stated for the competition is available to be won and all prizes will be awarded provided a sufficient number of eligible entries are received and prizes are validly claimed by the date provided in connection with the competition, after which no alternate winners will be selected or unclaimed prizes awarded. Unless otherwise disclosed in the prize description prior to entry, winners are responsible for all costs and expenses associated with claiming a prize. All taxes are solely the responsibility of each winner, although we reserve the right to withhold applicable taxes and each winner agrees to complete any required tax forms.</p>

<p>Your acceptance of a prize constitutes agreement to participate in reasonable publicity related to the competition and grants us an unconditional right to us to use your name, town or city and state, province or country, likeness, prize information and statements by you about the competition for publicity, advertising and promotional purposes and to comply with applicable law and regulations, all without additional permission or compensation. As a condition of receiving a prize, winners (or their parents or guardians) may be required to sign and return an affidavit of eligibility, liability release and publicity release.</p>

<p>6. Additional Provisions</p>

<p>Submissions and Unsolicited Ideas Policies</p>

<p>Our long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider unsolicited creative ideas, suggestions or materials. In connection with anything you submit to us &ndash; whether or not solicited by us &ndash; you agree that creative ideas, suggestions or other materials you submit are not being made in confidence or trust and that no confidential or fiduciary relationship is intended or created between you and us in any way, and that you have no expectation of review, compensation or consideration of any type.</p>

<p>Claims of Copyright Infringement</p>

<p>Notifications of claimed copyright infringement and counter notices must be sent to our designated agent:</p>

<p>Lance R. Griffin The Walt Disney Company 500 South Buena Vista Street Burbank, California 91521, USA Phone: +1 818-560-1000 Fax: +1 818-560-4299 Email: designated.agent@dig.twdc.com</p>

<p>We are only able to accept notices in the languages into which these terms are made available by us.</p>

<p>We will respond expeditiously to claims of copyright infringement committed using the Disney Services that are reported to our Designated Copyright Agent, identified above, in accordance with the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (&ldquo;DMCA&rdquo;) or, as applicable, other laws. With respect to Disney Services hosted in the United States, these notices must include the required information set forth in the DMCA and described in detail here.</p>

<p>Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</p>

<p>You and Disney Interactive agree to arbitrate all disputes between you and The Walt Disney Company or its affiliates, except disputes relating to the enforcement of The Walt Disney Company or its affiliates&rsquo; intellectual property rights. &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo; includes any dispute, action or other controversy between you and us concerning the Disney Services or these terms, whether in contract, tort, warranty, statute or regulation, or other legal or equitable basis. You and Disney Interactive empower the arbitrator with the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of these terms or formation of this contract, including the arbitrability of any dispute and any claim that all or any part of these terms are void or voidable.</p>

<p>In the event of a dispute, you or Disney Interactive must send to the other party a notice of dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving the notice, the facts giving rise to the dispute and the relief requested. You must send any notice of dispute to Disney Interactive, 500 South Buena Vista Street, Burbank, California 91521, USA, Attention: Legal/Arbitration Notice. We will send any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you. You and Disney Interactive will attempt to resolve a dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the notice of dispute is sent. After sixty (60) days, you or we may commence arbitration. You may also litigate a dispute in small claims court if the dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court, whether or not you negotiated informally first.</p>

<p>If you and Disney Interactive do not resolve a dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, the dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act. YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. Arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and its Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. For more information, visit www.adr.org or, in the United States, call 800-778-7879. Arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator may award damages to you individually as a court could, including declaratory or injunctive relief, but only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.</p>

<p>Unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, Disney Interactive will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitrator&rsquo;s fees and expenses. If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if we did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then we will pay you the amount of the award or US $1,000, whichever is greater, and pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys&rsquo; fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your attorney reasonably accrue for investigating, preparing and pursuing your claim in arbitration. We waive any right to seek an award of attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses in connection with any non-frivolous arbitration between you and us.</p>

<p>If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, United States of America, and you and Disney Interactive agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located there, in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>

<p>PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. Neither you nor Disney Interactive will seek to have a dispute heard as a class action, private attorney general action, or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding can be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to the arbitration or proceeding. If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration.</p>

<p>Choice of Forum</p>

<p>You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these terms or the Disney Services that is not subject to arbitration shall be filed, and that venue properly lies, only in the state or federal courts located in the borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, United States of America and you consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating such action.</p>

<p>Choice of Law</p>

<p>These terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the laws of the United States, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles.</p>

<p>Severability</p>

<p>If any provision of these terms shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>

<p>Survival</p>

<p>The provisions of these terms which by their nature should survive the termination of these terms shall survive such termination.</p>

<p>Waiver</p>

<p>No waiver of any provision of these terms by us shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
